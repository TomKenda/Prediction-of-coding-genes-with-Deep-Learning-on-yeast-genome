# Prediction of coding genes with Deep Learning on yeast genome

## Course BIRTI2101B - Data Science in bioscience engineering - Groupe6

### Abstract

This report is the result of project work in the course of Data Science in Bioscience
Engineering. The general theme of this yearâ€™s projects was: Deep Learning
in Bioscience Engineering. It was decided, by the group of student, to focus on the
prediction of coding DNA sequences, thanks to a deep learning method. The report
will thus try to address the following questions: Is Deep Learning a relevant method
to predict if a DNA sequence will code for a protein of not?

This report first presents a general overview of DNA sequencing, its history
methodology and some applications. Then, to understand how deep learning could
help, a small presentation on theoretical aspects is included. Thanks to the previously
cited knowledge, it will be possible to understand how to implement a deep
learning algorithm. Finally, in the last section, the results given by the model are
discussed. Different methods are compared, and the optimal parameter to solve this
problem are also given.
